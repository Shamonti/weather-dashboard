# Weather Dahsboard

This Weather Dashboard is a React app that enables users to search for the weather forecast for specific locations. The app uses the Open WeatherMap API to fetch weather information, shows current weather conditions, and offers a 5-day forecast. It also presents a visual representation of the forecast data using Chart.js. The app is created with create-react-app and uses React Icons for icons and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install Weather Dashboard.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the specific project-serving commands on any server for live development.

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Tech Stack

- React (create-react-app)
- Chart.js for data visualization
- React Icons for iconography
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Reflection

This was a challenge from OrangeToolz for the React Developer role. The project aimed to create a responsive weather dashboard with search by location, displaying current weather and a 5-day forecast, and visualizing forecast data.

One of the main challenges I encountered was the 5-day forecast. I expected the API to return data based on dates, but soon realized it was designed to display data at 3-hour intervals for each forecast. This led me to spend some time studying the API response.

At the end of the day, the technologies employed in this project include React, Chart.js, React Icons, and a substantial amount of JSX. I opted for Tailwind CSS to streamline responsiveness and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
